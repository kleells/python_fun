# CONDITIONALS, IF, ELIF, ELSE STATEMENTS

favorite_movie = "A League of Their Own" 

# Below, write a conditional statement that prints
# the string "that's a great movie" if the favorite_movie
# variable equals your favorite movie.
# Otherwise (else), print the string "that's not my favorite movie".  
# Mess around with the value of the favorite_movie
# variable and trigger both conditional responses:

if favorite_movie == "A League of Their Own":
  print("That's a great movie")
else:
  print("I've seen better")
