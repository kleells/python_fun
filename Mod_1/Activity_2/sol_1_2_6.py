# Use the correct operator to add variables a & c:

print(a+c)

# Use the correct operator to subtract variables b & c:

print(b-c)

# Use the correct comparison operator that shows if
# variables a & b equal each other:

print(a == b)

# Use the correct operator to find the quotient of variables c & a

print(c/a)

# Use the correct operator to find if variables c & b
# are not equal to each other:

print(c != b)
